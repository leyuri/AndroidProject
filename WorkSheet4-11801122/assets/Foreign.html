                My first overseas trip with my high school friends. <br>
                At the end of 2016, I visited on Christmas.<br>
                Kyoto was a quiet, perfect place for me.<br>
                It was so good just walking with my friends to the view.<br>
                <br>
              </p>

            <ul>
                <li><h3>Italy</h3></li>
              </ul>

                  I had a lot of work to do in 2017.<br>
                  Then I bought an Italian ticket on impulse.<br>
                  I was afraid because it was my first time traveling alone.<br>
                  However, this trip made me not afraid to do it alone.<br>
                </p>
       
              <ul>
                  <li><h3>Taiwan</h3></li>
                </ul>

                  A travel with friends in elementary school.<br>
                  The weather was very hot but fun because you stay with my friend.<br>
                  Dim sum for the first time I tried, but very delicious.<br>

                </p>          
      
            <br>


          That's how I got addicted to traveling. <br>
          I think traveling is time to get to know myself. <br>
